# Find Minimum in Array - C++ Program

This is a simple C++ program that finds the smallest number in an array using a linear search algorithm.

## ðŸ“„ Description

The program defines a function `findMinimum()` that takes an integer array and its size as input. It iterates through the array, comparing each element to find and return the minimum value.

## ðŸ§¾ How It Works

1. The array is initialized with a set of integer values.
2. The function `findMinimum()` is called with the array and its size.
3. It initializes the `min` variable with the first element.
4. It then loops through the rest of the array, updating `min` whenever a smaller element is found.
5. The smallest number is printed to the console.

## ðŸ’¡ Example

```cpp
Input:  arr[] = {9, 2, 14, 7, 3}
Output: The smallest number in the array is: 2
