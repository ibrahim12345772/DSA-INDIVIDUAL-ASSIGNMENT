Pointer-Based Selection Sort in C++
📝 Description
This C++ program implements the Selection Sort algorithm using pointers for element manipulation and traversal. Instead of using array indices, it makes use of pointer arithmetic for sorting and printing the array.

💡 Features
Pointer-based implementation of the classic Selection Sort algorithm.

Demonstrates element access, comparison, and swapping using pointers.

Prints the array before and after sorting for easy verification.

⚙️ How It Works
selectionSort(int* arr, int n):

Iterates through the array using pointers.

Finds the minimum value in the unsorted part of the array.

Swaps it with the current element using pointer dereferencing.

printArray(int* arr, int n):

Prints array elements using pointer traversal.

main():

Defines a test array.

Displays the original array.

Calls the selection sort function.

Displays the sorted result.

Original array: 29 10 14 37 14 
Sorted array: 10 14 14 29 37 
🚀 How to Compile & Run
Ensure you have a C++ compiler like g++ installed.

Compile:
bash
Copy
Edit
g++ -o selection_sort selection_sort.cpp
Run:
bash

./selection_sort
📊 Time Complexity

Case	Time Complexity
Best Case	O(n²)
Average	O(n²)
Worst Case	O(n²)
Space	O(1) (In-place)
Selection Sort always performs O(n²) comparisons, regardless of initial order.

Memory-efficient due to in-place sorting with no extra space required.

📎 Notes
Great for understanding pointer arithmetic and how sorting works at a lower level.

Not the most efficient for large datasets — use Merge or Quick Sort for better performance.
